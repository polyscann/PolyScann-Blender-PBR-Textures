PolyScann provides free PBR textures that work well in Blender for environment art, game assets, and visualization.

All textures are created from real-world scans and processed to be physically correct. They can be used directly in Blender without extra conversion.

You can find brick, ground, wall, rock, and concrete materials on the website.

All assets are released under the CC0 license and can be used for personal or commercial projects.
